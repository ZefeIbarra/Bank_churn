# Customer Churn Prediction at Anonymous Multinational Bank

Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction project at Anonymous Multinational Bank. In the competitive world of banking, retaining customers is vital for sustaining business growth. This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and prediction model to tackle one of the industry's crucial challenges: predicting customer churn.

## About the Project

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. In the context of the banking industry, customer churn could mean customers closing accounts, stopping usage of banking services, or switching to other banks. This project aims to analyze the customer data of account holders at Anonymous Multinational Bank and predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not.

## Features and Data

The dataset includes a variety of customer attributes that can provide insights into their behavior and interactions with the bank. Some of the features include:

-RowNumber—corresponds to the record (row) number and has no effect on the output.
-CustomerId—contains random values and has no effect on customer leaving the bank.
-Surname—the surname of a customer has no impact on their decision to leave the bank.
-CreditScore—can have an effect on customer churn, since a customer with a higher credit score is less likely to leave the bank.
-Geography—a customer’s location can affect their decision to leave the bank.
-Gender—it’s interesting to explore whether gender plays a role in a customer leaving the bank.
-Age—this is certainly relevant, since older customers are less likely to leave their bank than younger ones.
-Tenure—refers to the number of years that the customer has been a client of the bank. Normally, older clients are more loyal and less likely to leave a bank.
-Balance—also a very good indicator of customer churn, as people with a higher balance in their accounts are less likely to leave the bank compared to those with lower balances.
-NumOfProducts—refers to the number of products that a customer has purchased through the bank.
-HasCrCard—denotes whether or not a customer has a credit card. This column is also relevant, since people with a credit card are less likely to leave the bank.
-IsActiveMember—active customers are less likely to leave the bank.
-EstimatedSalary—as with balance, people with lower salaries are more likely to leave the bank compared to those with higher salaries.
-Exited—whether or not the customer left the bank.
-Complain—customer has complaint or not.
-Satisfaction Score—Score provided by the customer for their complaint resolution.
-Card Type—type of card hold by the customer.
-Points Earned—the points earned by the customer for using credit card.



## Goals

The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can identify potential churners in advance. By identifying customers who are likely to churn, the bank can take proactive measures to retain them through personalized offers, improved services, or targeted communications.
